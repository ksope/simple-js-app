Pokédex Project

Javascript app using the bootstrap library framework and jquery to fetch 150 pokémons from an external API and add to my pokemon list. You can access the code to my project at https://github.com/ksope/simple-js-app.

You can copy or download the files locally to see how it works: Simply click on any button to see the details of each pomémon's (i.e. name, height and image of it).
The modal window can be closed by pressing the pressing 'Escape'key, clicking on the 'Close' or 'X' button or simply clicking outside the modal window.
